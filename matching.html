            <h2>What was the project about?</h2>
            <p class="description">
              Deciding where and what to study can be hard.
              Our matching app SchoolMatch helps students looking for a new education by matching them with schools that align with their interests.
              This is a web app build with HTML, CSS & Javascript. We used MongoDB to handle our database, Github for version control & we used the MVC (model-view-controller) model.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
              This is how it works: from a personal account, you can set your preferences. Do you want to study a certain subject, or do you need to be in a certain city? 
              This will then match you to a number of schools you might like. You can then chat with a representative from a school you may be interested in to ask questions and gather more information.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
              During this project we worked in a team of 6. First, each team member took on building one part of the app. Later we merged these parts into a coherent whole.
              This helped us to learn more about version control and how to communicate effectively when working together on a project.
            </p>

            <h2>Teamwork</h2>
            <p class="description">
              Our team started this project by dividing the tasks: who will be responsible for what part of the app?
            </p>
            <p class="description">
              We started with 4 people working together on the Register and Login functions that were needed to make an account. These 4 also all had an individual task related to the login function:
            </p>
            <ol class="description">
              <li>Making it possible to change login data (email & password)</li>
              <li>Login with Google using Passport</li>
              <li>Sending a confirmation email with Nodemailer after you've registered</li>
              <li>Logging out, starting/ending sessions</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="description">
              In the meantime one of us focussed on getting info from the form and then displaying the right matches.
              Another team member worked on building a chat where users could talk to representatives of the schools.

            <h2>Request & Response</h2>
            <p class="description">
              It was my task to design a form and show the user the right matches from our database of schools.
            </p>
              
            <p class="description">
             First, some schools had to be added to our database. I added about 15 local schools with data about their location, level of education and study subjects.
             When there is a request, all schools get pulled from the database. To filter this data, I wrote a filter function.
            </p>
            
            <p class="description">
              First I had to get the input from the form. 
              For example, to get the requirements for the education level, I had to put name="niveau" in the form where the value gets chosen. 
              Then I referenced this piece of input in the controller with this code:
              <code class="code">niveau: req.body.niveau</code>
            </p>
            <p class="description">
              Then I could reference 'niveau' again to add it to a query, like so: 
              <code>const queryNiveau = {niveau: keuze.niveau};</code>
              <code>const query = {...queryLocatie, ...queryNiveau, ...queryOnderwerp};</code>
              This query is then applied on all schools:
              <code>const filtered = await scholen.find(query, null, options).lean();</code>
              All schools that meet the requirements of the query are then rendered on the results page, like this: 
              <code>res.render('matches', {scholen: filtered});</code>
            </p>
            
            <p class="description">
              Finally, in the view, I used Handlebars to load the dynamic data into the page.
              I wanted to display the name, location, level and subjects of each school.              
              For example, the niveau of each school would be loaded like this:
              <code>{{#each scholen}} ... {{this.niveau}}</code>
              Now the user can see a list of all the schools that fit their requirements,
              each school including a button that links to a chat. üí¨

              Then we did one last test on our development branch to make sure everything was still working correctly, before merging it to main.

            <h2>Testing</h2>
            <p class="description">
              I also wrote some tests for my part of the project. 
              Writing tests for your application can save you a lot of time and effort in the long run, because you don't have to 
              manually try every function in the browser after you've modified something in your code.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
              There are several testing frameworks with which you can test a node.js app before deployment.
              I wrote my tests using Mocha. ‚òï Mocha uses third-party assertions, mocking and spying tools such as the assertion library Chai. 
              It supports many different libraries, this makes it a very flexible framework. 
            </p>
            <p class="description">
              I wanted to test whether information could reliably be posted and retrieved from the database (I kept checking it manually while coding). 
              That's why I tested the POST and GET routes of our project. For example, I let the POST-test post a test document to the database. 
              And for the GET-route I tested whether the response has a status '200', which means something was found.
